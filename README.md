# Automated CI/CD Pipeline Implementation using Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, Docker, and Deploying in Kubernetes using Gitops tools like ArgoCd

Here in this Project -->
- we will deploy the simple JAVA application on Kubernetes following the CI/CD practices. We will use Jenkins as our Continuous Integration tool and we use ArgoCd as a CD part and deploy our app in Kubernetes using it. 
- We use tools like Maven for building the app, for UNIT and Integrated testing and then we will send the artifacts in Nexus, sonarqube for the static code analysis, use Docker to build the images and push them to the docker hub.

- Orchestrated an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline utilizing Jenkins, SonarQube, Nexus, Docker, and Argo CD, streamlining Java application deployment onto Kubernetes.
- Automated the software delivery process, integrating tools for code analysis, artifact management, and containerization to ensure high-quality and efficient application deployment.
- Implemented Jenkins for Continuous Integration and Argo CD following the GitOps approach for Continuous Delivery, optimizing software development and deployment workflows
